# Logs Directory

This directory contains various log files generated by the Face Mask Detection System.

## Log Files

### system.log
- General system logs including startup, errors, and operational messages
- Format: `timestamp - logger_name - level - message`

### violations.csv
- CSV file containing detailed violation records
- Columns:
  - `timestamp`: Date and time of violation
  - `violation_type`: Type of violation (e.g., "No Mask")
  - `confidence`: Confidence score of the detection
  - `face_position`: Position of the detected face (x,y coordinates)
  - `duration`: Duration of the violation (if applicable)

### training_history.png
- Training history plots showing accuracy and loss curves
- Generated after model training completion

## Log Levels

- **INFO**: General information about system operations
- **WARNING**: Warning messages and alerts
- **ERROR**: Error messages and exceptions
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information (if enabled)

## Log Rotation

Logs are automatically managed with:
- Maximum file size limits
- Automatic rotation to prevent disk space issues
- Timestamp-based archiving

## Violation Logging Features

- **Cooldown Period**: Prevents duplicate violations from the same face within 5 seconds
- **Position Tracking**: Records face position for spatial analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Includes model confidence for quality assessment
- **Timestamp Precision**: Accurate timing for compliance monitoring

## Usage in Analysis

The log files can be used for:
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Performance analysis of the detection system
- Historical violation tracking
- System debugging and troubleshooting

## Privacy Considerations

- No personal identification information is stored
- Only face positions and detection metadata are logged
- Images are not saved to respect privacy
- Logs can be cleared or disabled as needed

## File Management

- Logs are automatically created when the system starts
- Old logs can be archived or deleted as needed
- CSV format allows easy import into spreadsheet applications
- Log files are human-readable for manual inspection
